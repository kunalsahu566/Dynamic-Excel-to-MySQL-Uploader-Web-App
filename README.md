# Dynamic-Excel-to-MySQL-Uploader-Web-App
📝 Project Description:

Built a full-stack web application using Python (Flask), MySQL, HTML, and Tailwind CSS to automate the process of uploading Excel/CSV files directly into a MySQL database.

    🔌 Backend (Python + Flask): Handles file uploads, MySQL connection validation, table creation, and data insertion using pandas.

    💾 Database (MySQL): Stores structured data dynamically based on uploaded files.

    🎨 Frontend (HTML + CSS): Designed responsive and user-friendly forms for database login and file uploads using Tailwind CSS.

    📁 Functionality: Automatically creates MySQL tables from uploaded files, converts Excel/CSV data into database entries, and confirms upload success or failure via flash messages.
